# PocketBase Deploy to Fly with CI/CD Demo

Demo repository for deploying a [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/) app to [Fly.io](https://fly.io/)!

[Check out the related video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnDiooLuhmc)!

If you've got [Johnnify Premium](https://johnnify.com/premium), you can check out an implementation of [a real app using this](https://github.com/johnnify/travel-pocket)!

[Travel Pocket](https://travel-pocket.vercel.app/) uses PocketBase as the CMS, and SvelteKit to consume it on the frontend.
